# Module 13 Challenge - Venture Funding with Deep Learning

## Description

In this excercise, we are acting as a venture capital firm with the hopes to create a model that can evaluate funding applications from startups and predict whether they will be successful if funded by the venture capital firm. In this Jupyter Lab Notebook, we utilize our knowledge of machine learning and neural networks to evalulate and classify different funding applications on whether or not they will be successful.

The sections of this notebook are as follows: 

* Prepare the data for use on a neural network model. 
* Compile and evaluate binary classification model using a neural network.
* Optimize the neural network model.

## Technologies

This project leverages JupyterLab Version 3.0.14 in association with Anaconda distribution and the Conda package manager.  The following packages are also used: 

* [pandas](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas) - Data analysis toolkit for Python.

* [sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) - Predictive data analysis.

* [tensorflow.keras.models](https://www.tensorflow.org/) - Open source machine learning platform.

* [keras](https://keras.io/) - Deep learning API running on top TensorFlow.

## Installation Guide

Before running the application, install Python modules Pandas, hvPlot, SQLAlchemy and Voila:

```python

  conda install pandas

  conda install numpy

  pip install -U scikit-learn

  pip install tensorflow

```
